# UnityStateFrame
State machine framework for activity-based games.
It was originally built for dual Oculus Go and desktop PC games. Go code is now stripped out.
* Single event class that can be fed with any input data
* Tracks picking and other activities like pouring, blowing, shooting etc
* Simple way of overriding default behaviour based on current activity and state
